## Introduction
The goal of Anonymous Self Reflections is to allow users to post and share reflections and find resources. By posting anonymous reflections, users can see that they are not alone in feeling certain emotions and can reflect and focus on their own mindfulness.

## Use Case
The user of the app will be able to post and edit reflections. Each entry allows users to enter a date, location, and mood. The user can view all entries posted and post their own.

## UX
The initial wireframes for the page and the list of results can be seen below.
